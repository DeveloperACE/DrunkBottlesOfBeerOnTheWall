# DrunkBottlesOfBeerOnTheWall

The lyrics to "99 bottles of Beer on the Wall" with a twist.

This project started as an assignment in my Intro to Programming class where we had to re-create the lyrics to "99 bottles of Beer" using recursive functions. It soon turned into a creative twist on my original code where the lyrics get more and more drunk as more beers are consumed.
